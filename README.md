# SAB-ABAP-Training-Tasks
SAP ABAP Programming

This project focuses on developing a custom SAP ABAP Module Pool Program integrated with ALV Reports for managing employee data efficiently. The application provides a user-friendly interface for fetching, inserting, and deleting employee records using a table control in the Module Pool Program. Additionally, an ALV report is implemented with selection-screen filters and radio buttons to display data in List or Grid view.

## Objectives:
Develop a DDIC Table (ZEMPLOYEE_TABLE) to store employee details, including EMP_NO, EMP_NAME, GENDER, EMAIL_ID, and DEPT.
Implement a Module Pool Program with a Table Control to display employee records dynamically based on department selection.
Create an Admin Panel with tab strips for inserting and deleting employee records.
Design an ALV Report with radio buttons to toggle between List View and Grid View, and filtering options based on Carrier ID or City From - City To.
Integrate Table Maintenance Generator (TMG) to facilitate manual data entry and validation within SAP.
